How Solr Handle Image Search?
=============================

Try to explore the possibility and capability of Lucene/Solr 
to search image, the actural image instead of the image file name.
That means we will search the overall metadata of a image:

- file name
- author
- aperture
- shutter spped
- focal length
- ISO
- exposure
- exposure time

This post `Simple photo search`_ offers a quick example about 
how to do image search by using Solr.
